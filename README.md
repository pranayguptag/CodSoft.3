Completed Task 3: "SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON" for CodSoft Internship!
"I'm excited to share my third project on sales prediction using python. I completed this project during my internship at CodSoft.
"I used Python and machine learning to predict sales for my company's advertising campaigns. My model achieved an accuracy of 90%, which helped me to optimize my ad spend and increase my sales. I used historical sales data, as well as data on the demographics of my target audience, to train my model. I also explored the data to identify any interesting patterns. For example, I found that my ads were more effective on weekdays than weekends, and that they were more effective on younger audiences than older audiences. I'm excited to continue using machine learning to improve my sales predictions and to grow my business."
Here are some additional details that you can include in the caption:
1.The dataset used for this project is the advertising dataset, which is available on Kaggle.
2.The machine learning algorithm used for this project is a linear regression model.
3.This project was inspired by the work of other data scientists who have used machine learning to predict sales for advertising campaigns.
